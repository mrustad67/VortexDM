I HAVE TESTED AND RUN THIS IN LINUX MINT
------------------------------------------


i loved  using FireDM  when it was abondoned i was disoriented and searched for many months and finaly found VortexDM.  But although vortexDM is good but it has some bugs 
1- during installation there are some spelling mistakes which fail installation.  i have corrected those commands in this fork
2- second bug is that vortexDM fails to download batches.  batc download bug remains unfixed yet.

i have made this fork to correct those commands which kept me from installing VortexDM.  so no other goes through trouble i had to go.  find correct commands below.

# Renaming the project to Vortex Download Manager and will carry on where FireDM 2022.2.5 left off. Original project, FireDM, by Mahmoud Elshahat. RIP

The original creator removed the project repository from Github but left it on PyPI. The latest version they published there, 2022.4.14, I believe was purposely sabotaged to not work and anybody who accepted the update in FireDM would be left with the broken version. ~~If you want to install from PyPI install 2022.2.5 and don't update. https://pypi.org/project/FireDM/2022.2.5~~ 2022.2.5 is now gone from PyPI.

# Known Issues:
- Linux X-server will raise an error if some fonts are missing especially emoji fonts - See Dependencies below

- Mac - Tkinter, as mentioned in "python.org" the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk 8.5 has serious bugs that can cause application crashes. If you wish to use Tkinter, do not use the Apple-supplied Pythons. Instead, install and use a newer version of Python from python.org or a third-party distributor that supplies or links with a newer version of Tcl/Tk.

- systray icon: depends on Gtk+3 and AppIndicator3 on linux, please refer to your distro guides on how to install these packages if you need systray to run properly

# Dependencies:

**Note for PycURL:**
For Windows users who wants to run from source or use pip:
Unfortunately, PycURL removed binary versions for Windows and it now has to be built from source. See here: http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html#windows
`python -m pip install pycurl` will fail on Windows, your best choice is to use the portable version.
